# JavaScript code sample
You can get JS sample code for trial running in folder 'JavaScript'. You can go to your browser, press F12 and try running each piece of my sample code for better
understanding 'JavaScript' contains 3 subfolders (Basic, Design Pattern and OOP).
Folder 'Basic' has all code samples for basic knowledge in JS that you need to know. You need to visit this folder before the other 2.
Folder 'OOP' has code samples for how to create and use a "class" in JS. Please visit this folder after finnishing with 'Basic'
Folder 'Design Pattern' has code samples for some advance JavaScript knowledge that you might want to know. Since this is some advance JS (according to my opinion).
I suggest you to check out this one after fully understanding basic JS
